               <h1 class="ol">Visual creativity.</h1>
               <p class="sh">There's more visual freedom in parallax website design.Rather than focousing on block style information architecture,you can create refreshing and engaging visuals such as animations or beautiful photography,that act as a continuum,ultimately inspiring users to scroll further down the page.</p>

                <P class="sh">Do you want to tell a story with your product or service? Long-scrolling lends itself well to a narrative and encourages meaningful interaction from users. </P>

                <h1 class="oi">SIMPLE INTERFACE FOR SMART DEVICE USERS</h1>
                <p class="sh">Mobile and tablets have evolved the way we engage in websites.It's now less about clicking and more about scrolling,swiping and tapping.Long-scrolling websites take away the barrier of complex navigation,providing a responsive,user friendly experience for mobile users.</p>

                <h1 class="oi">PUNCHY,STRAIGHT TO THE POINT MESSAGING</h1>
                <p class="sh">Parallax website design is a great solution for us time poor website browsers,as it forces businesses to convey their message and vision into one dynamic webdesign page.</p>

                <h1 class="oi">FASIER FOR USER TO RELAISE THEIR GOAL</h1>
                <p class="sh">These days scrolling is so simple that it's become an instinctive action, whereas clicking through to another page requires thought and motivation.A single page website allows user to identify their purpose on the website quicker, then needing to shift through multiple pages.</p>

                <h1 class="oi">LONG SCROLL:THE NOT SO GOOD STUFF</h1>
                <h1 class="ol">YOU NEED TO BE SEARCH ENGINE SAVY</h1>
                <p class="sh">One of the biggest problems that parallax websites face is that they are not so SEOfriendly.Why? When you limit the number of pages on your website, Google has fewer pages to index and negatively impacts your standing on the searc engine results page(SERP). Luckily there are ways around this.</p>

            <div class="am">
                <h1 class="oi">SLOWER LOAD TIMES</h1>
                <p class="sh">50% website users bounce off the page if it hasn't loaded in 3.5 seconds. So the more imagery and animations you include, the longer it takes to load the page. When writing this article, We tested some popular parallax websites, and found that the ones with complex visuals took upto 30seconds to load on a mobile device, where as simple and minimalist long scroll websites loaded within a few seconds</p>

                 <h1 class="oi">AWKWARD NAVIGATION</h1>
                 <p class="sh">Instead of hitting "back" button, users must scrollback up the page which can be frustating for users who want to refer back to a certain element. An easy way around this is to include top navigation and have each element anchored to a category or section</p>
